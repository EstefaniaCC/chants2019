<br>Ana Aguiar is Assistant Professor at the University of Porto (UPORTO), researcher at Instituto de Telecomunicações (IT) since 2009. Her research interests lie in the field of wireless and mobile systems, recently focusing on vehicular networks, WiFi networks with mobility, mobile IoT, and applications of data science for smart mobility. She coordinates the Networked Systems Group and leads Shannon Lab at IT/UP. She is also adjunct coordinator of the Center of Competences for Future Cities at UP, running the UrbanSense environmental sensors and the crowdsensing tool SenseMyCity, which resulted from the FP7 Future Cities project (FP7-REGPOT-2012-2013-1). She lead the national VOCE project on voice stress detection, and participated in more than 15 projects, in 9 of them as co-PI or WP leader. She published more than 60 journal and conference articles, is reviewer for several IEEE transactions and Computer and Communication Societies’ conferences, and expert with the EC (EX2013D158837).
<br><strong>Title:</strong>
<em>Mobile Wireless Systems for Smart Mobility</em>
<br><strong>Abstract:</strong> Smarter mobility is expected to play a key role in the reduction of urban carbon footprint by changing the way people move. Mobile wireless systems can foster this change by supporting better transportation planning and by improving the mobility experience in more environmental friendly modes. This talk will discuss requirements, challenges, and solutions for both dimensions collected during 7 years of experimental projects in the field of intelligent mobility in the city of Porto. Concretely, I will quantify challenges of using mobile crowdsensed data for traffic research, and show how it may still be useful to urban planners. I will also showcase applications that leveraeg wireless systems and mobile Internet of Things on public and soft transportation, characterising performance and identifying limitations of the solutions.

<br><strong>Title:</strong>
<em>Spectrum measurement and management for future spectrum-sharing networks</em>
<br><strong>Abstract:</strong> Mobile wireless networks are at a tipping point. While traditionally they have been a key enabler of distributed Internet applications, in recent years they have become throttled by heterogeneous and bandwidth-hungry applications such as immersive virtual reality and the Internet of Things. The rapid growth of the number of connected devices and the volume and diversity of traffic they generate calls for a fundamental rethink in wireless network design and operation. In addition, future wireless networks have to be conceived with an outlook towards inclusiveness to equally cater to infrastructure-challenged environments such as rural and post-disaster areas.

This talk will introduce our work on future networks with Dynamic Spectrum Access. We will begin by discussing the speed and latency requirements of future applications. We will then talk about our work on automating the measurement and management of the radio spectrum for future spectrum-sharing applications. In the second part of the talk, we will discuss challenges that inhibit mobile wireless network advances in infrastructure-challenged areas and discuss the advantages of shared spectrum access for such environments. We will talk about several of the systems we have developed to bridge the connectivity gap in rural areas and discuss their applicability in rural emergency preparedness and response.

<br>Challenged networks comprise those situations where communication is desired, but traditional Internet architectures fail to provide it effectively. Such networks may be characterized by intermittent connectivity, a heterogeneous mix of nodes, frequent nodal churn, and widely varying network conditions. The applications of challenged networks range from time-critical communications such as for disaster relief to delay-tolerant transmission in poorly connected regions or where censorship should be counteracted. However, challenged networking has also found many applications in everyday settings, for which they were not initially conceived, such as opportunistic networking supporting data-centric communications, traffic offloading from cellular networks, mobile cloud/edge computing, opportunistic and participatory sensing as well as challenged IoT with limited resources.

CHANTS builds on the success of the thirteen previous CHANTS workshops and WDTN 2005, and aims to stimulate research on the most novel topics of challenged networking research. This year’s edition encourages submission of theoretical and experimental work (including studies of real deployment), with <strong>a primary interest in new directions of challenged networking in concrete application scenarios and demonstrators in areas such as autonomous driving, underwater robots, emergency response operations, underground mining, interplanetary missions, polar research and unmanned aerial vehicles.</strong> The workshop seeks original work presented in the form of research papers describing new research approaches and results, as well as demo and poster submissions. Highly disruptive work-in-progress and position papers are also welcome, provided they focus on particularly innovative solutions or applications for challenged networks. All papers shall be forward-looking, describe their relationship to existing work, and shall argue their impact and implications for ongoing or future research.
